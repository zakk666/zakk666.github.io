## Intro

A good design should be not only beautiful but also emotional.  

I am not going to dicuss every aspect of "Emotional Design", rather, I will focus on just the "UI Animation" which is what I do every day.

Since this is a dicussion about UI animation, all the example here is live and handcoded so that you can feel it, play with it.

There will be also some techniques I usually use to achieve a certain feeling I want.

Also, some background about my self: not coming from a motion graphic background.

This is a summary of my own experience and also a study on this subject.

## Overall

- like a dream, you don't know when it starts nor when it ends.
- when opacity + translate, translate first. so there is no "starts"
- customized easing.
- duration.
- no matter what is the goal, the animation should always serve the contents, hence "UI Animation".
